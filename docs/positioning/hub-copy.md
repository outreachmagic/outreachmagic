## Website hero

**Headline:** Your AI Agent Has a Blind Spot. Fix It.

**Subheadline:** Claude Code and Cursor can write brilliant cold outreach. But after they hit send, they go blind. Outreach Magic gives your AI agent a persistent memory of every lead, every reply, every bounce — across every sequencer you use.

**CTA:** [Start Free] [See How It Works]

**Social proof:** "From zero to full pipeline visibility in under 2 minutes. One command."

## Website feature blocks

**Stop Stitching CSVs** — Before: export from Smartlead, Heyreach, Instantly, merge in Sheets. After: `pipeline.py pull` → done.

**Local-First by Design** — SQLite on your machine. Push/pull relay to move between Claude Code, Cursor, Hermes.

**Actually Free to Start** — Unlimited local tracking + 1,000 relay events/mo. Pro $9/mo for sequencer sync.

**Built for AI Agents** — Structured CLI output. Every workflow assumes an LLM is on the other end.

**Cross-Platform. One Pipeline.** — Push from one machine, pull on another.

## Short copy snippets (social / directories)

**Ultra-short:** The data layer for AI SDRs. Sync Smartlead, Instantly, Heyreach into local SQLite.

**Pain-point hook:** Tired of exporting CSVs from Smartlead and Heyreach just to answer "did we get any replies?"

**Differentiation:** Every GTM skill tells your agent what to write. This one tells your agent what's happening.

## FAQ (website / pricing page)

**What counts as an event?** Relay-synced webhook events from connected sequencers. Local commands (`add-lead`, `show`, `stats`, dedup checks) are free and unlimited.

**What happens if I exceed my limit?** Free: friendly upgrade prompt; relay returns HTTP 429 when hard limit hit. Pro: 50k cap — we reach out personally if you're approaching it.

**Can I switch platforms?** `pipeline.py sync` on machine A, `pipeline.py pull --full` on machine B.

**Is it really free?** Yes for local tracking and 1,000 relay events/mo. Pro ($9/mo) unlocks full sequencer sync.
