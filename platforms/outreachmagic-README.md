Outreach Magic turns your outbound pipeline into a local SQLite database your AI agent can query directly. Every reply, click, bounce, and booked call from every sequencer lands in one place — on your machine, in real time.

**Works with Claude Code, Cursor, and Hermes.** No CSV exports, no merged sheets, no API pagination.

## How it works

| Step | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| You connect your sequencers | Smartlead, Instantly, HeyReach, PlusVibe, EmailBison, Prosp, MasterInbox, Calendly |
| Webhooks flow to one endpoint | One webhook per platform — no per-client or per-campaign setup |
| Events sync to a local SQLite DB | Every lead move, reply, bounce, and booking lands on your machine |
| Your agent reads it directly | Your AI agent queries the database — no API, no dashboard, no round trip |

The result: your agent can answer questions like "who replied this week?" or "which campaign has the highest reply rate?" — without you exporting a CSV or opening a dashboard.

## How the skills fit together

```
  email-finder ──►  lead-enrich  ──►  outreachmagic
  (find emails)     (research)       (your pipeline DB)
       │                  │                 │
       └───── all local ──┴──── queries ────┘
```

| Skill | What it does | Works alone? |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **outreachmagic** | Pipeline DB — syncs sequencer data, stores replies + events, agent queries it directly | Needs relay account |
| **lead-enrich** | Find anyone by name + company — LinkedIn, domain, website | Yes, just a Serper key |
| **email-finder** | Waterfall email lookup through trykitt and Icypeas | Yes, just API keys |

All three install together. The companion skills check your pipeline before spending credits — if you already have someone's data, they skip the lookup and save you money.

## Getting started

**In your agent (Claude Code, Cursor, or Hermes), paste this:**

> Fetch https://github.com/outreachmagic/outreachmagic/blob/main/AGENTS-INSTALL.md and follow its instructions exactly to install the Outreach Magic skill suite on this machine.

Or run the installer directly:

> Download `install.sh` from the latest release on this repo, verify the SHA256 checksum, then run `bash install.sh --platform <your-agent>` where platform is `hermes`, `cursor`, or `claude`.

After install, connect your account:

> Run `pipeline.py login` from your terminal — it opens a browser where you sign in. Then connect your sequencers in the portal at app.outreachmagic.io.

**Once connected, ask your agent things like:**

- "Show me leads who replied this week"
- "Which campaign has the highest reply rate?"
- "Pull the latest events and give me a pipeline briefing"
- "Are there leads still interested from yesterday?"
- "How many bounces did we get on the A/B test campaign?"
- "Export leads that haven't been contacted yet"

## What people use it for

| Who | Why it clicks |
|-----|---------------|
| **GTM engineers** | Stop writing n8n pipelines to merge sequencer data. Your agent reads a local SQLite DB instead. |
| **SaaS founders** | Know what's working without dashboard-hopping. $9/mo instead of $200/mo in half-solutions. |
| **Agencies** | One webhook per platform. Route by campaign name. Query across every client from one terminal. |
| **AI agent builders** | Give your agent pipeline awareness. Let it answer "who replied?" without API integration. |

## Pricing

| Plan | What you get | Price |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Free** | Local tracking + CLI pipeline view + 1,000 webhook events/month | $0 |
| **Pro** | Full sequencer sync + 50,000 events/month + all integrations | $9/mo |
| **Scale** | 250,000 events/month + unlimited workspaces + priority support | $29/mo |

Only webhook traffic from sequencers counts toward limits. Local queries, tracking, enrichment, and exports stay unlimited on every plan.
